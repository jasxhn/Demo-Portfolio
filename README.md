# Demo Portfolio Website

This is a **demo portfolio website** I created to showcase my front-end and full-stack development skills.  
The design and structure were built with guidance and feedback from my mentor, who helped me refine my layout, responsiveness, and visual balance.

## 🧠 About This Project

I built this website as a **practice project** — a place to apply what I’ve learned about modern web design, HTML, CSS, and UI structure.  
Since this is a **demo**, I’ve used **placeholder details** (like fake contact info and education) just to illustrate how the final portfolio could look.
